## Instructions

The project consists of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files along with 2 audio files and 1 image file for the background.

The game starts with a deck of randomly shuffled grid of 16 cards. The user can select any two cards and flip them to  check whether their symbols match or not.
If they match, lock their position
If they don't match, flip them back and continue.

The game ends when all the cards are matched.

The number of moves, the time taken and the rating is also displayed in the end.
